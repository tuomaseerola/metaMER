# Analysis

This assumes that the data has been parsed from the BibTeX files into table and exported as CSV file.

## Read annotated data

```{r}
#| eval: false
d <- read.csv('data/meta-analysis_data.csv')
```

We need to identify the core metrics:

- _correlation coefficient_ (obtained from $R^2$) for regression studies.

- _Matthew's correlation coefficient_ for classification studies.

- n (we use STIMULUS_N rather than participant n)

- Subsetting base on model and music qualities

## Analyse

### Regression studies

#### Valence

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| eval: false
library(dmetar)
library(tidyverse)
library(meta)

# select regression studies

m.cor <- metacor(cor = valence, 
                 n = stimulus_N,
                 studlab = study_id,
                 data = df,
                 fixed = FALSE,
                 random = TRUE,
                 method.tau = "REML",
                 method.random.ci = "HK",
                 title = "MER: Regression: Valence: All")
