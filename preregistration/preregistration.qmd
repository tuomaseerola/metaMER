    background ="The aim is to establish the current state of the model success in predicting emotions expressed by music from audio. We will focus on the last 10 years of research and especially the research that has predicted valence and arousal ratings from music audio. No such analysis exists and there are interesting challenges in predicting emotional content of music that relates to specificity of the music and the type of emotions and features used that would benefit from a systematic analysis.",

How are the prediction rates related to genres of music, the type of models used, the type of features, modelling design and cross-validation utilised, and the model complexity and parsimony?",

    expectations_hypotheses = "Prediction of arousal ratings is generally high and robust, and in terms of the model outcome metrics (correlation), achieves at least r = 0.77 (R square of 0.60).
