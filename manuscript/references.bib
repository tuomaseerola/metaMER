@article{hashem2023,
	abstract = {The speech emotion recognition (SER) field has been active since it became a crucial feature in advanced Human--Computer Interaction (HCI), and wide real-life applications use it. In recent years, numerous SER systems have been covered by researchers, including the availability of appropriate emotional databases, selecting robustness features, and applying suitable classifiers using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). Deep models proved to perform more accurately for SER than conventional ML techniques. Nevertheless, SER is yet challenging for classification where to separate similar emotional patterns; it needs a highly discriminative feature representation. For this purpose, this survey aims to critically analyze what is being done in this field of research in light of previous studies that aim to recognize emotions using speech audio in different aspects and review the current state of SER using DL. Through a systematic literature review whereby searching selected keywords from 2012--2022, 96 papers were extracted and covered the most current findings and directions. Specifically, we covered the database (acted, evoked, and natural) and features (prosodic, spectral, voice quality, and teager energy operator), the necessary preprocessing steps. Furthermore, different DL models and their performance are examined in depth. Based on our review, we also suggested SER aspects that could be considered in the future.},

	abstract = {Temporal dynamics have been increasingly recognized as an important component of facial expressions. With the need for appropriate stimuli in research and application, a range of databases of dynamic facial stimuli has been developed. The present article reviews the existing corpora and describes the key dimensions and properties of the available sets. This includes a discussion of conceptual features in terms of thematic issues in dataset construction as well as practical features which are of applied interest to stimulus usage. To identify the most influential sets, we further examine their citation rates and usage frequencies in existing studies. General limitations and implications for emotion research are noted and future directions for stimulus generation are outlined.},

	abstract = {The striking ability of music to elicit emotions assures its prominent status in human culture and every day life. Music is often enjoyed and sought for its ability to induce or convey emotions, which may manifest in anything from a slight variation in mood, to changes in our physical condition and actions. Consequently, research on how we might associate musical pieces with emotions and, more generally, how music brings about an emotional response is attracting ever increasing attention. First, this paper provides a thorough review of studies on the relation of music and emotions from different disciplines. We then propose new insights to enhance automated music emotion recognition models using recent results from psychology, musicology, affective computing, semantic technologies and music information retrieval.},

@inproceedings{soleymani2013,
	abstract = {Music is composed to be emotionally expressive, and emotional associations provide an especially natural domain for indexing and recommendation in today's vast digital music libraries. But such libraries require powerful automated tools, and the development of systems for automatic prediction of musical emotion presents a myriad challenges. The perceptual nature of musical emotion necessitates the collection of data from human subjects. The interpretation of emotion varies between listeners thus each clip needs to be annotated by a distribution of subjects. In addition, the sharing of large music content libraries for the development of such systems, even for academic research, presents complicated legal issues which vary by country. This work presents a new publicly available dataset for music emotion recognition research and a baseline system. In addressing the difficulties of emotion annotation we have turned to crowdsourcing, using Amazon Mechanical Turk, and have developed a two-stage procedure for filtering out poor quality workers. The dataset consists entirely of creative commons music from the Free Music Archive, which as the name suggests, can be shared freely without penalty. The final dataset contains 1000 songs, each annotated by a minimum of 10 subjects, which is larger than many currently available music emotion dataset.},

	abstract = {A common approach to studying emotional reactions to music is to attempt to obtain direct links between musical surface features such as tempo and a listener's responses. however, such an analysis ultimately fails to explain why emotions are aroused in the listener. in this article we explore an alternative approach, which aims to account for musical emotions in terms of a set of psychological mechanisms that are activated by different types of information in a musical event. this approach was tested in 4 experiments that manipulated 4 mechanisms (brain stem reflex, contagion, episodic memory, musical expectancy) by selecting existing musical pieces that featured information relevant for each mechanism. the excerpts were played to 60 listeners, who were asked to rate their felt emotions on 15 scales. skin conductance levels and facial expressions were measured, and listeners reported subjective impressions of relevance to specific mechanisms. results indicated that the target mechanism conditions evoked emotions largely as predicted by a multimechanism framework and that mostly similar effects occurred across the experiments that included different pieces of music. we conclude that a satisfactory account of musical emotions requires consideration of how musical features and responses are mediated by a range of underlying mechanisms.},

@article{Mehr2019universality,
	abstract = {It is unclear whether there are universal patterns to music across cultures. Mehr et al. examined ethnographic data and observed music in every society sampled (see the Perspective by Fitch and Popescu). For songs specifically, three dimensions characterize more than 25\% of the performances studied: formality of the performance, arousal level, and religiosity. There is more variation in musical behavior within societies than between societies, and societies show similar levels of within-society variation in musical behavior. At the same time, one-third of societies significantly differ from average for any given dimension, and half of all societies differ from average on at least one dimension, indicating variability across cultures.Science, this issue p. eaax0868; see also p. 944INTRODUCTIONMusic is often assumed to be a human universal, emerging from an evolutionary adaptation specific to music and/or a by-product of adaptations for affect, language, motor control, and auditory perception. But universality has never actually been systematically demonstrated, and it is challenged by the vast diversity of music across cultures. Hypotheses of the evolutionary function of music are also untestable without comprehensive and representative data on its forms and behavioral contexts across societies.RATIONALEWe conducted a natural history of song: a systematic analysis of the features of vocal music found worldwide. It consists of a corpus of ethnographic text on musical behavior from a representative sample of mostly small-scale societies, and a discography of audio recordings of the music itself. We then applied tools of computational social science, which minimize the influence of sampling error and other biases, to answer six questions. Does music appear universally? What kinds of behavior are associated with song, and how do they vary among societies? Are the musical features of a song indicative of its behavioral context (e.g., infant care)? Do the melodic and rhythmic patterns of songs vary systematically, like those patterns found in language? And how prevalent is tonality across musical idioms?RESULTSAnalysis of the ethnography corpus shows that music appears in every society observed; that variation in song events is well characterized by three dimensions (formality, arousal, religiosity); that musical behavior varies more within societies than across them on these dimensions; and that music is regularly associated with behavioral contexts such as infant care, healing, dance, and love. Analysis of the discography corpus shows that identifiable acoustic features of songs (accent, tempo, pitch range, etc.) predict their primary behavioral context (love, healing, etc.); that musical forms vary along two dimensions (melodic and rhythmic complexity); that melodic and rhythmic bigrams fall into power-law distributions; and that tonality is widespread, perhaps universal.CONCLUSIONMusic is in fact universal: It exists in every society (both with and without words), varies more within than between societies, regularly supports certain types of behavior, and has acoustic features that are systematically related to the goals and responses of singers and listeners. But music is not a fixed biological response with a single prototypical adaptive function: It is produced worldwide in diverse behavioral contexts that vary in formality, arousal, and religiosity. Music does appear to be tied to specific perceptual, cognitive, and affective faculties, including language (all societies put words to their songs), motor control (people in all societies dance), auditory analysis (all musical systems have signatures of tonality), and aesthetics (their melodies and rhythms are balanced between monotony and chaos). These analyses show how applying the tools of computational social science to rich bodies of humanistic data can reveal both universal features and patterns of variability in culture, addressing long-standing debates about each.Studying world music systematically.We used primary ethnographic text and field recordings of song performances to build two richly annotated cross-cultural datasets: NHS Ethnography and NHS Discography. The original material in each dataset was annotated by humans (both amateur and expert) and by automated algorithms.What is universal about music, and what varies? We built a corpus of ethnographic text on musical behavior from a representative sample of the world{\textquoteright}s societies, as well as a discography of audio recordings. The ethnographic corpus reveals that music (including songs with words) appears in every society observed; that music varies along three dimensions (formality, arousal, religiosity), more within societies than across them; and that music is associated with certain behavioral contexts such as infant care, healing, dance, and love. The discography{\textemdash}analyzed through machine summaries, amateur and expert listener ratings, and manual transcriptions{\textemdash}reveals that acoustic features of songs predict their primary behavioral context; that tonality is widespread, perhaps universal; that music varies in rhythmic and melodic complexity; and that elements of melodies and rhythms found worldwide follow power laws.},

	abstract = {Protocols of systematic reviews and meta-analyses allow for planning and documentation of review methods, act as a guard against arbitrary decision making during review conduct, enable readers to assess for the presence of selective reporting against completed reviews, and, when made publicly available, reduce duplication of efforts and potentially prompt collaboration. Evidence documenting the existence of selective reporting and excessive duplication of reviews on the same or similar topics is accumulating and many calls have been made in support of the documentation and public availability of review protocols. Several efforts have emerged in recent years to rectify these problems, including development of an international register for prospective reviews (PROSPERO) and launch of the first open access journal dedicated to the exclusive publication of systematic review products, including protocols (BioMed Central{\textquoteright}s Systematic Reviews). Furthering these efforts and building on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, an international group of experts has created a guideline to improve the transparency, accuracy, completeness, and frequency of documented systematic review and meta-analysis protocols{\textemdash}PRISMA-P (for protocols) 2015. The PRISMA-P checklist contains 17 items considered to be essential and minimum components of a systematic review or meta-analysis protocol.This PRISMA-P 2015 Explanation and Elaboration paper provides readers with a full understanding of and evidence about the necessity of each item as well as a model example from an existing published protocol. This paper should be read together with the PRISMA-P 2015 statement. Systematic review authors and assessors are strongly encouraged to make use of PRISMA-P when drafting and appraising review protocols.},
